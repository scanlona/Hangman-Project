## Path and Build Commands (On My System)

Navigate to the project space within your terminal. The following is
the command on my device:

`cd /mnt/c/Users/antho/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Hangman-Project`

To compile and build the program, run the following command next, I did this in WSL:

`gcc 'hangman.c' -o 'hangmanRun'`

To execute the program, simply run the following command:

`./hangmanRun`

Use the previous command every time you want to run the program again.
